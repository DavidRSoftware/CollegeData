# CollegeData
  I was assigned to completed a one-time programming assignment for a startup company where I was instructed to extract information on course offerings from a college website into an Excel spreadsheet. The download_college_data method is written in Python and downloads the HTML for course offerings at the Binghamton college website. This HTML is not available immediately upon visiting the website but requires you to fill out drop down lists before you are given access to the HTML for course offerings. I made use of Splinter, which is a software package for Python, to automate the process of filling out the drop down lists and downloading and writing the HTML.
  The write_to_excel method is written in Python and uses regular expressions to extract information on college courses from the HTML that was downloaded using the previously shown method and stores that information in a spreadsheet.
